        and in Vietnam as the Resistance War Against America or simply the American War,
        was a conflict that occurred in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to
        the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975

            The Ku Klux Klan, commonly called the KKK or simply the Klan,
        refers to three distinct secret movements at different points in time in
        the history of the United States. Each has advocated extremist reactionary
        positions such as white supremacy, white nationalism, anti-immigration
        and—especially in later iterations—Nordicism and anti-Catholicism.

        <p>
            In the movie, a man asks Forrest Gump for ideas of T-shirt designs.
        Forrest Gump wipes his muddy face on a T-shirt and the movie shows a
        smiley face on the T-shirt. which soon becomes a famous and very popular
        symbol in the United States It is during the 1970's that the smiley face was
        invented to show a stylized representation of a smiling human face.

            However, there was no cross-country runner or struggling t-shirt salesman,
        there was no truck or mud puddle. There was, however, a graphic designer,
        some devious salesmen, and an ambitious newspaper man – all add up to a
        surprisingly complex history for such a simple graphic.

            In the movie, Forrest Gump becomes very adept at playing ping pong.
        In fact, he is so good that he is asked to play on the American team against the Chinese.
        This is a clear parallel to the term Ping Pong Diplomacy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ping-pong diplomacy refers to the exchange of table tennis players between
            the United States and People's Republic of China in the early 1970s.

            When the American soldiers returned home from the World War II,
            they were greeted as heroes. Parades were held everywhere to honour their sacrifices.
            Unfortunately, those honour seemed a luxury to the Vietnam veterans.
            They were mistreated. Some veterans recalled that when they had just landed,
            people were demonstrating against them. “Many spit on us, and called us rude names.”
            American society was divided by the Vietnam War as its people were full of doubt about
            its righteousness. Also, Vietnam, as opposed to the World War II, was a deeply unpopular
            war. American public, as a result, tried their best to forget about it and tended to
            forget its veterans as well.

            In the Forrest Gump film, Forrest meets the President in Washington, D.C.
            to be congratulated when he is certified an All-American football player
            for his performance at the University of Alabama. Presented with free
            food and drink, Forrest indulges in (he estimates) 15 Dr. Peppers,
            so that when he is asked by the President on live television
            "How does it feel to be an All-American?" all he can think to say
            is "I got to pee". Later, Forrest laments on President Kennedy's
            assassination, followed by that of his brother Robert Kennedy in 1968.
        </p>
        <p>
            John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States,
            was assassinated on Friday, November 22, 1963,
            in Dallas, Texas, while riding in a presidential motorcade through
            Dealey Plaza.
            Kennedy was riding with his wife Jacqueline,
            Texas Governor John Connally, and Connally's wife,
            Nellie when he was fatally shot.

            Forrest Gump, one day, decides to “go for a little run.”
            He runs from coast to coast, gradually amassing a crowd of followers.
            Reporters want to know what his motivation is — is he running or women’s rights?
        </p>
        <p>
            Women's rights are the rights and entitlements claimed for women and
            girls worldwide, and formed the basis for the women's
            rights movement in the nineteenth century and feminist
            movement during the 20th century.

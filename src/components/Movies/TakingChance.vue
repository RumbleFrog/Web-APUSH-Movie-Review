        On May 28, 2018, we observe the holiday
        for we now call Memorial Day for the 150th time.
        For many students, myself included as well think of
        it as nothing more than another three-day weekend.
        Unfortunately, the tendency to see the holiday as merely
        an opportunity to hang out with your friends more obscures
        even the purpose of what the day was meant to observe:
        a solemn time, thanking for those who fought and to ensure
        that those who follow will not forget the sacrifice of those
        who died.  In the history of the world, many good soldiers
        have died bravely and honorably for wicked or unjust causes.
        And that it's after watching "Taking Chance" that I truly can
        recall the real purpose, the imagery portrayed in the movie
        highlights the life-scarring situations the soldiers have to
        go through to give us the opportunity for an education,
        freedom and many others. Americans are fortunate in that
        we have been given a way of avoiding this situation by
        linking the sacrifice of our soldiers to the meaning of the nation.

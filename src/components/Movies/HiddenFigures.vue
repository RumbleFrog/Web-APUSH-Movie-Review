        It's my pleasure today to invigorate a forgotten member
        within our society. One that we cannot function today
        without him existing, and you might think it's some white
        male! But it's not! It's one of the most exceptional African
        American there are; he changed our lives and how we function
        in society today. And that person is Benjamin Banneker! Born
        on November 9, 1731, in Ellicott's Mills, Maryland. A free
        black man who owned a farm near Baltimore created one of
        the first automatic mechanical clocks. The importance of
        this is that without this creation, we wouldn't have our
        clocks that hang on our walls, to tell the time of when to
        go to our next class or be on time for an appointment. His
        invention of the first wooden clock that was reputed to keep
        accurate time revolutionized the industry. But he is often
        not mentioned when it comes to devices that keep track of
        time. Why may you ask? Is it because he is an African
        American, leaving him irrelevant? Or is it because he was
        never indeed represented? I'd say it's a mix of both, the
        hatred for black at the time was strong at heart, so much
        so that during his burial, mourners were startled to see
        his house had caught on fire, quickly burning down. Can't
        be a coincidence that the fire burned down on the day of
        his death. An explicit representation of pure hatred
        against African Americans at that time. And what exposure
        in the media do they have if they are considered sub-human?
        None. And for that, it's my duty today to represent the
        person that help put a face to America's modern industry.
        For that, we thank him for his invention.
